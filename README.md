## Mission
I was hoping to skip the necessity of building out our own CMV3 front end.. but currently it is seeming like it will be faster than searching through all of the broken templates. At least until we have our own developers.

We need a space to sell our RWA NFTs to our community, with an NFT membership gate on the minting. 
1. In the beginning we will create a single product template that we can continue to relaunch as we create new projects. 
2. As we scale, a front end portal will be developed so that we can manage members, launch new opportunities, and create amazing mind-blowing utility based dashboards.

## The Past
Leaving this below as a reminder of where we came from.... because it'll be unrecognizable when we land. -- After a small dive into the current systems.. we are close to having a frictionless environment

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
